# LitterMeUp

LitterMeUp is an android app that focuses on street litter. The aim is to combat street litter in a fun way, more specifically street litter in Brussels. They do this by taking a picture of street litter, once this is reported any user can see it and take initiative to clean it up. After it is cleaned up, they receive x number of points. To later convert these into coupons, which they can use anywhere. This project was made as part of the Trends III course.

## Documentation

You should be able to clone this project into your IDE, and run
it directly. 

Please note that because this is a school project, and we use a free
key for the maps SDK, you will need to change it to your own key.

In the AndroidManifest.xml you will find <meta-data> tag with a key, 
that you will need to change. You can make an account on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), then
going to the APIs & Services -> Library you can add the map SDK for android 
and generate a key.
